Running MT with -p --cases 0 --autoInclude --tstp

---------------------------------------------------------------------
two-variable-problem-1

SOS hangs on:

assume "¬ rra * (rra * (rra * (- 1 / 4))) < rr * (rra * (rra * (- 3 / 4)) + rr * (rra * (3 / 4) + rr * (- 1 / 4))) ∧ ¬ rr * (rra * 2) ≤ rra * (rra * - 1)"
then have "¬ rr < rra ∨ ¬ 0 < rr"


---------------------------------------------------------------------
two-variable-problem-2

SOS takes more than 5 secs on:

assume "¬ 0 < rr * rr ∧ ¬ rra ≤ rr * - 1"
then have "¬ 0 < rr ∨ ¬ 0 < rra"


---------------------------------------------------------------------
two-variable-problem-3
two-variable-problem-3-weak
two-variable-problem-3-weak2

MT hangs on all of these

MT hangs


---------------------------------------------------------------------
exp-problem-1

Termifying the ATP proof takes very long. Probably because it contains very large numbers, which are converted very inefficiently to Isabelle Num. --- Now fixed!

But SOS hangs on some univariate steps involving large numbers. Why?

  assume "¬ rr < - 1 ∧ ¬ - 1 < rr * (rr * - 1) ∧ ¬ 1 < rr * rr"
  then have "¬ 1 + rr < exp rr * (1 + rr * (rr * - 1))"

mt_arith_rule fails on this step. It doesn't fit into the expected pattern and I haven't found anything I can add to metitarski_simps to solve the goal only by simplification.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
exp-fun-ineq-b
exp-fun-ineq-b-corrected

Very slow with these options. MT hangs


---------------------------------------------------------------------
log-fun-ineq-f

Involves two variables so sos hangs on some steps.
There is also a step where mt_arith_rule fails:

assume "¬ 1 < rr ∧ ¬ rr ≤ 0"
then have "¬ 0 < ln rr * exp 1"

cos-problem-4

refute_0_12: "pi" in fed into "decision". SOS doesn't accept "pi". Would the Isabelle RCF decision procedure accept "pi"?
