\section{MetiTarski --- The Problem}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MetiTarski}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\item Automatic theorem prover (ATP).
	\note[item] {This means that the user doesn't need to do anything. Just pushes a button ans waits for the proof.}
\item Proves universally quantified inequalites involving:
	\vspace{0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item polynomials
	\item real-valued special functions: $log$, $exp$, $sin$, $cos$, $sqrt$ etc.
	\end{itemize}
\item Using:
	\vspace{0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item resolution
	\item a decision procedure for the theory of real closed fields (RCF).
	\end{itemize}
\item Special functions are \textit{approximated} by polynomials. 
	\note[item]{So Metitarski is incomplete. There are some inequalities that are true but it cannot prove. (But without the approximations, the problem is undecidable.)}			
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{block}{Long-term Goal}
Use MetiTarski inside Imandra to solve geometric problems.
\end{block}
	\note[item]{These can be encoded as inequalities that MT understands.}

\vspace{1cm}	
Why translate MetiTarski proofs to Isabelle proofs?
\vspace{0.5em}
	\note[item]{If we want to use MT to verify things, we need very high confidence in its proofs.}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\item No formal guarantee of correctness.
	\note[item]{MetiTarski was coded in Standard ML and there is no guarantee the code or the output is correct. Although it has of course been tested.}
\item Isabelle is more trustworthy.
\item Integrate MetiTarski into Isabelle.
	\note[item] {If proof reconstruction is available, MetiTarski can be included as an automated tool in Isabelle.}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%Side by side picture of an MT and Isabelle proofs
	\note[item]{We need to turn this MT proof into an Isabelle proof. You probably can't read this because the proofs look horrible, and that's exactly the point. You want to be able to do this translation automatically. Roughly what happens is that every step in the MT proof corresponds to a "have" in Isabelle and a proof method.}
	\note[item]{In Isabelle, the way you do proofs is you can specify intermmediate steps, prove them, and then use them later to prove your conclusion. To prove things you need to specify a proof method, there are maybe 10-15 that are commonly used. And sometimes you have to give Isabelle hints about what lemmas to use.}
\end{frame}

\section{Approach}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sledgehammer}

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\item Automatic proof tool in Isabelle.
	\note[item] {It turns out there is a tool in Isabelle that does something similar. Isabelle is an \textit{interactive} theorem prover so it normally requires a lot of user input to do a proof, the user has to specify what steps should be taken. Sledgehammer aims to improve automation.}
	
	\note[item] {Sledgehammer tries to automatically find a proof for the given lemma without any user input. What it does is it calls a bunch of ATPs and tries to translate their proofs into Isabelle proofs. Which is exactly what I need to do.}

\item Sledgehammer operation:
\end{itemize}

	\note[item] {When the user invokes Sledgehammer the current goal is translated into some intermediate form, this ATP problem, which is an ML datastructure. This is given to the ATP, it comes up with a proof, which you can put into this standard format of an ATP proof, and then translate it to an Isabelle proof. This is of course a simplified diagram of what happens but you get the idea.}
	\note[item] {The left part of the diagram is specific to every prover, because to get the ATP proof we need some information about how the initial Isabelle lemma was encoded. And this of course depends on each prover. But the right part of the diagram does not depend on the prover. And it is actually the more involved part. So the idea was to somehow reuse this part when reconstructing Metitarski proofs.}

\frametitle{Translations}
	\note[item] {I'm going to focus first on the left side of the diagram before, which involves multiple translations of the problem and the proof. The part I said was prover specific.}
	\note[item] {Because Isabelle is written in SML, any code that wants to interface with it must access the ML internals. So all of the code for this diagram is in SML. So for example there is an internal representation of theorems as an ML datatype and you need to use that to manipulate the statement of theorems.}
	\note[item] {Explain difference between higher-order syntax and first-order using +}

\subsection{Proof Generation}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Generating Isabelle Proofs}
	\note[item] {This is the part of Sledgehammer we decided to reuse, the right of the diagram. From the ATP proof with higher-order terms to the actual Isabelle proof text. Sledgehammer already has a lot of sophisticated functionality implemented for this, apart from the textual translation. Explain each of it.}
%	\note[item] {It takes the termified ATP proof with higher-order-terms and translates it to this:}

	\note[item] {But what is difficult is choosing the appropriate proof method for each step in the proof. Because this depends on what steps the prover made. So I had to change the Sledgehammer code to for the MT proofs to work.}
	\note[item] {In particular MetiTarski does some algebraic simplifications so a custom Isabelle method is needed to mirror it. So lately I've been building this method but it still needs more experimentation.}
	\note[item] {I mentioned that MT uses a decision procedure for real closed fields. This needs to be formalised in Isabelle as a proof method. At the moment,one of Larry's students has a formalisation for the univariate case that we can use. But ideally we would extend it to multivariate.}
	\note[item] {In the beginning of the talk I also said that special functions are approximated with polynomials. These approximations are inequalities that MT considers to be axioms. So in Isabelle you would need to prove these inequalities before using them. Some of these have already been formalised but they need to be brought to the exact form that MT uses. While some still need to be proved.}
